# 🧩 SemanticSyntax Philosophy

**SemanticSyntax** is more than a set of PHP libraries — it is a philosophy of how code should be written and shared.  
Our mission is to provide tools and examples that demonstrate how **syntax** (form) and **semantics** (meaning) can work together to produce code that is not only valid but also clear, logical, and maintainable.

---

## 🔹 Syntax (Form)
Syntax defines the **rules of structure** that make code valid for interpreters and compilers. Examples:
- In PHP, each statement ends with a `;`.
- In JavaScript, functions are declared with the `function` keyword.
- In CSS, properties are expressed as `property: value;`.

✅ **Principle**: Correct syntax ensures that code runs without errors.

---

## 🔹 Semantics (Meaning)
Semantics defines the **meaning** of the code — what it does and why it matters. Examples:
- A function named `validateEmail` communicates its purpose better than `check`.
- Clean architecture and clear naming make code understandable without comments.

✅ **Principle**: Good semantics ensures that code is human-readable and logically aligned with its intent.

## 🔹 Semantic Syntax (Together)
The term **SemanticSyntax** represents the harmony of both aspects:
- **Syntax** → Code that runs.
- **Semantics** → Code that makes sense.

💡 In practice, SemanticSyntax means:
- Following **PSR standards** (PSR-2 for legacy PHP, PSR-12 for modern PHP).
- Providing **tests, linting, and static analysis** for clarity and reliability.
- Writing code that is **self-explanatory**, reusable, and free of unnecessary complexity.

---

## 🌍 Why It Matters
- **For Developers**: Clean, semantic code is easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
- **For Communities**: Open-source contributions should emphasize clarity, so anyone can learn and build on them.
- **For Legacy Projects**: Even old PHP 5.6 code can be refactored into structured, understandable examples.

## 📐 How We Apply This Philosophy
- **PHP 5.6 Package** → Legacy-friendly, minimal, demonstrates clarity even in constrained environments.
- **PHP 7.4 Package** → Strict typing and stronger semantics for modern apps.
- **PHP 8.1+ Package** → Future-proof, enterprise-level strictness, embracing union types, `mixed`, and immutability.

Each package shows the same philosophy adapted to its environment.
