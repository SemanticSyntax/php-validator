## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability
- Please report security issues **privately** through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/SemanticSyntax/php-validator/security/advisories).
- Do **not** open a public GitHub Issue for security problems.
- Alternatively, you may use the **Security** tab in the GitHub repository.

## ⏱ Response Time
- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **72 hours**.
- You will receive updates as the issue is reviewed and addressed.
- Fixes and advisories will be published once a solution is available.

## 🔑 Philosophy
Security is a core part of the SemanticSyntax brand:  
**Code that makes sense must also be safe.**  
All reported issues are treated with priority, fairness, and confidentiality.
